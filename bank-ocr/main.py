# NaÃ¯ve: Hash of seven-segment representation of digits 0-9
# Upgrade: compare seven-segment to alphanum, probability of character match, offer guess

# - open file
# - read lines
# - identify chunks (first line with only pattern [0] or [1])
# - cut chunks at last line (3)
# - hold chunk in memory while cutting top,mid,bottom line into n subsegs
# - verify that the subsegs line up
# - combine subsegs into segs
# - turn segs into array
# - find array in seven_segments -> that index is the digit
# - return int(string) of all digits in that chunk
# - go thru file until last chunk completed
